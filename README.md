# Programming Fundamentals Project
This was our first ever C++ project in which we were tasked to create a code that performed multiple operations on matrices. Since this was assigned to us very early in our Programming Fundamentals class we were only limited to for,while loops, if-else statements and implementing basic functions etc.
